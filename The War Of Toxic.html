I’m... finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact, so... I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I’m here to tell you: there’s nothing to worry about. Uh, you’ll do fine! So... let’s just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?-Phone Guy</strong>

            <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGISTS </h1>
            <p> Great General William(Purple Guy), who founded the country with incredible tactics, brings his daughter Elizabeth (circus baby) to power after founding the country. Lefty, who was against William at first but then teamed up with William with William's excellent design, is very effective on defense. William is a master of attacking. William dies because he participated in wars, but he always comes back.</p>
